    "\n",
    "Interpolation of literals or expressions into quoted expressions. Interpolation is indicated by a prefix `$`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Julia allows interpolation of literals or expressions into quoted expressions\n",
    "* `$` interpolation syntax allows inserting only a single expression into an enclosing expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "## `Eval`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given an expression object, one can cause Julia to evaluate (execute) it at _**global scope**_ using `eval`.\n",
    "    * Executing `eval` can also have side-effects that alter the state of the enclosing module's environment.\n",
    "* Every [module](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/modules/#modules-1) has its own `eval` function that evaluates expressions in its global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions on `Expr`\n",
    "\n",
    "* A function can also take one or more Expr objects as arguments, and return another `Expr`.\n",
    "* In JPL, it is possible to _**generate and manipulate Julia code within Julia itself**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Macro\n",
    "\n",
    "* A macro maps a tuple of arguments to a returned expression.\n",
    "* The resulting expression is compiled directly rather than requiring a runtime `eval` call.\n",
    "* Macros execute when code is parsed. They allow the programmer to generate and include fragments of customized code before the full program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hygiene\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a macro, there are usually two concers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Macros _**MUST**_ ensure that the variables they introduce in their returned expressions _**do not accidentally clash with existing variables**_ in the surrounding code they expand into.\n",
    "1. A macro may be called in a different module from where it was defined. In this case we need to ensure that _**all global variables are resolved to the correct module**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Julia solves the above problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variables within a macro are classified as either local or global.\n",
    "    * A variable is considered local if it is assigned to (and not declared global), declared local, or used as a function argument name.\n",
    "    * Otherwise, it is considered global.\n",
    "1. Local variables are then renamed to be unique\n",
    "    * using the [gensym](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#Base.gensym) function, which generates new symbols\n",
    "1. Global variables are resolved within the macro definition environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "macro time(ex)\n",
    "    return quote\n",
    "        local t0 = time()\n",
    "        local val = $ex\n",
    "        local t1 = time()\n",
    "        println(\"elapsed time: \", t1-t0, \" seconds\")\n",
    "        val\n",
    "    end\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the macro's locals will not conflict with any user variables, and `time` and `println` refer to the Julia Base definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Escape the macro hygiene\n",
    "\n",
    "* The escaping mechanism can be used to \"violate\" hygiene when necessary, _**in order to introduce or manipulate user variables**_.\n",
    "* Expression escaping is done with [esc](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#Base.esc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following descriptions are from Julia's manual. I cannot understand it very well right now. Just paste them here.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Getting the hygiene rules correct can be a formidable challenge.\n",
    ">1. Before using a macro, you might want to consider whether a function closure would be sufficient.\n",
    ">1. Another useful strategy is to defer as much work as possible to runtime.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For example, many macros simply wrap their arguments in a QuoteNode or other similar Expr. Some examples of this include `@task body` which simply `returns schedule(Task(() -> $body))`, and `@eval expr`, which simply `returns eval(QuoteNode(expr))`.\n"
