    "### Notes (and how to understand these concretely?)\n",

    "1. All values in Julia are **true objects** having a type that belongs to a single, fully connected type graph, all nodes of which are equally first-class as types.\n",
    "\n",
    "   > In mainstream object oriented languages, such as C++, Java, Python and Ruby, [composite types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type) also have named functions associated with them, and the combination is called an \"object\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is no meaningful concept of a \"compile-time type\": the **only type** a value has is its actual _**type when the program is running**_.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Only values, not variables, have types – variables are simply names bound to values.\n",
    "1. Both abstract and concrete types can be parameterized by symbols, by values of any type for which `isbits` returns true."
